# ursina-car-game
it is a car game made with ursina, it has got decent physics, controls are w,a,s,d to move and r to reset car position.
I will continue to update the code.

To run the code, install python 3 and Ursina engine, make sure all the files are in the same directory and that all the assets remain in the asset folder
